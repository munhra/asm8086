    Microsoft CodeView version 3.14 corrects a problem found in CodeView
    version 3.10 that shipped with the BASIC Professional Development 
    System version 7.1.  The problem can result in loss of data when 
    CodeView 3.10 is used in conjunction with high memory drivers found 
    in third party products, HIMEM.SYS, and a future version of DOS.

    Use the UNPACK utility provided on this disk to install CodeView 3.14, 
    then remove CodeView 3.10 from your hard drive.  For example, to 
    install CodeView 3.14 in the default BC7.1 directory for DOS executables, 
    place this disk in drive A and type the following:

       > A:
       > UNPACK CV.EX$ C:\BC7\BIN\CV.EXE

    Debugging Run-Time Module Programs with CodeView
    ------------------------------------------------
    The following steps must be taken in order to view the BASIC source code 
    of a program that was compiled to use a run-time module (not compiled 
    with /O option) in CodeView 3.14:

    1. Start CodeView as usual (for example, type CV TEST.EXE).  The source 
       window will only display the assembly listing for your program.

    2. To display the BASIC source code for your program, choose the Open 
       Source command from the File menu and open the BASIC source file for
       the program.

    3. To retain the BASIC source code listing throughout your debugging
       session, set a breakpoint on the first line of the BASIC source code.
       Each time you restart your program, CodeView will stop execution at
       this breakpoint and load the BASIC source into memory for execution
       tracing.

    4. Run the program.  CodeView will stop execution at the breakpoint, but 
       from then on will display BASIC source while you are debugging.  

    Note, the preceding steps are not needed to view source code when using 
    CodeView with stand-alone programs (compiled with /O option).
